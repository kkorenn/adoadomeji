## Requirements

- .NET SDK 8 or newer
- A Dance of Fire and Ice
- Unity Mod Manager installed for A Dance of Fire and Ice

The build scripts use the default macOS Steam installation path. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and adjust the paths when your installation is elsewhere.

## Build

```bash
./scripts/run.sh check
./scripts/run.sh build
./scripts/run.sh package
```

- `check` validates scripts and runs the executable test projects.
- `build` creates a Debug build, validates Unity/Mono compatibility, and installs it to `Mods/Adomeji`.
- `package` creates a verified Release build and produces `build/Adomeji.zip` and `build/Adomeji.update.json`.
